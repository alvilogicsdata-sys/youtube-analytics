  Running the Application Locally

  To run this application on your local machine, you would need to:

   1. Install Required Software:
      - Node.js (for both backend and frontend)
      - PostgreSQL database
      - Redis server
      - Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

   2. Set Up the Backend:
      - Navigate to the youtube-data-api directory
      - Run npm install to install dependencies
      - Set up PostgreSQL database with the provided schema
      - Create a .env file with your YouTube API key and database credentials
      - Run the server with npm start

   3. Set Up the Frontend:
      - Navigate to the nextjs-youtube-frontend directory
      - Run npm install to install dependencies
      - Run the development server with npm run dev

   4. Alternative: Using Docker:
      - Navigate to the project root
      - Create a .env file with all required environment variables
      - Run docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build

  Current Limitation

  Since I've created all the files through the file system, they exist as code but haven't been executed yet.
  The application would need to be run on your local machine after installing the prerequisites.

  Would you like me to provide detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the application on
  your local machine? I can guide you through the complete setup process including:
   - Installing prerequisites (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Setting up environment variables
   - Running both the backend and frontend
   - Connecting to a YouTube API key
   - Database setup

  Just let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I'll provide the detailed instructions to get the
  application running on your local browser.
